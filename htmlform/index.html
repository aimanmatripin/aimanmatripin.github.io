					<p>Eric Cantona, in full Eric Daniel Pierre Cantona (born May 24, 1966, Marseille, France) French football (soccer) player who was one of the sport’s biggest stars in the 1990s and is best known for his key role in reviving the English powerhouse club Manchester United and for his temperamental play.</p>

					<h2>The Biography</h2>
					<p>One of the most flamboyant players ever to play the game, Eric Cantona’s antics off the field often seem to outshine his brilliance on the field. Eric’s career start with the small French side Auxerre, and from there he moved on to first division team Marseille for a fee of £2.3 million.</p>
					<p>It was during his stay at Marseille that Eric’s temper began to surface. Having been substituted in a friendly against Torpedo Moscow, Eric ripped off his jersey and threw it to the ground in disgust. Marseille imposed a short ban for his actions. Around the same time, Eric found himself banned form the French National Team for insulting the coach on French TV. It wasn’t until Michel Platini took over that Eric was asked to play once again for Les Bleus.</p>
					<p>Not long after all this, Eric was loaned to Bordeaux, but he moved on to Montpeiller, where he had one of his best seasons, helping the club win the French Cup. The following year he returned to Marseille, however injuries kept him sidelined, and once again he found himself at another club, this time Nimes. Troubles followed him, and while at Nimes Eric found himself called before the French Football Association for throwing a ball at a referee during a match. When the French FA handed him a one month ban for his actions, Eric called them all idiots and the FA raised the ban to 2 months.</p>
					<p>This didn’t sit well with the spirited Cantona, and he decided in retaliation to retire early from the game that he loved.</p>
					<p>Retirement didn’t last long as Eric was convinced to come out of retirement and move to England. Refusing a tryout with Sheffield Wednesday, he joined Leeds, and in his second year with the team helped them win the league title. Ironically, Eric found it hard to remain in the first team with Leeds and soon found himself offloaded to Manchester United where his legendary status continued to grow. He helped lead Man United to championship after championship. It was with Man United that he made his biggest mistake – the legendary “Kung Fu” kick.</p>
					<p>In a 1995 game against Crystal Palace, Eric ran into the stands and kicked a fan for shouting racial slurs at him. He was dealt a heavy fine and sentenced to serve 120 hours of community service plus a 9-month ban from the game. Eventually Eric rejoined Man United and helped them win several more championships, but his retirement in 96-97 surprised everyone. Many people felt he could have played many more years.</p>
					<p>In 2001 he was voted Manchester United’s player of the century, and to this day United fans refer to him as “King Eric”.</p>
					<p>He then embarked on an acting career, starring in movies such as Elizabeth. He is currently playing/managing the French National Beach Soccer team.</p>
